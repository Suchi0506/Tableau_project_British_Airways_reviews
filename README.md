This Tableau project delves into the comprehensive analysis of airline passenger experiences worldwide. Leveraging data from two main tables, it provides insights into various aspects of air travel, including flight details, traveler feedback, and geographic distributions.

## Key Components: ##
1. Flight Analysis: Explore flight details such as date, route, aircraft type, and traveler type to understand travel patterns and preferences.
2. Passenger Feedback: Analyze passenger ratings on seat comfort, cabin staff service, food and beverages, ground service, and entertainment to assess overall satisfaction levels.
3. Geographic Insights: Utilize geographic data to visualize flight destinations, country-wise ratings, and continent-wise distributions to identify regional trends.
4. Recommendation Assessment: Examine the impact of recommendations on passenger satisfaction and trip verification status.
5. Performance Metrics: Track key performance indicators such as value for money and overall rating to gauge airline performance and customer perception.

## Objective: ##
To provide airlines and stakeholders with actionable insights to enhance the passenger experience, improve service quality, and drive customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## What I have done ##
+ First, I converted the data into their desired data type. For example country was present in string data type and it was converted to geographic data type.
+ The data contained numerous airlines out of which i filtered 10 airlines based on count of reviews given by customer and grouped rest of them and named it "Various".
+ Created a bar graph to demonstrate average overall rating by aircraft and number of reviews.
+ Created an interactive map to demonstrate average overall rating by country.
+ Created a line chart to show average cabin staff service by month.
+ Created filters based on metrics, date, seat type, traveller type, country and aircraft to mae it more interactive and user friendly.

## Insights ##
+ Average cabin staff service recorded worse during May 2020
+ Average overall rating was recorded highest in Czechia which is 9.5
+ Boeing 747-400 tops the list as having most satisfied customer based on average overall rating provided by customers amongst many airlines.
